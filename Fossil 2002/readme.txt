NOTES

This is my first Winamp skin. It was designed to look like the Fossil 2002 watch series from
Fossil (TM), which is a remake of the first digital watches. My first intention was to make
a modification of Hydro's Onkyo skin, but after getting into it I changed my plans.
Everything except the interface's texture and the buttons was created by me. Please check
the credits for more.

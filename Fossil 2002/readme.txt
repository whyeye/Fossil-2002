Thank you for downloading this skin. Make sure you have at least Winamp 1.8, otherwise you
are not able to use this skin as your Winamp interface. Check www.winamp.com for the latest
release of Winamp.
 

[INSTALLATION NOTES]

Unzipping to your winamp/skins directory will create a subfolder called 'Fossil 2002' which
includes all skin data. Launch Winamp, go to the option-menu and use the skin-browser to
select the skin.

For users of Winamp 2.04 or higher it's enough to copy the ZIP-File to the winamp/skins
directory.


[NOTES]

This is my first Winamp skin. It was designed to look like the Fossil 2002 watch series, 
which is a remake of the very first digital watches. My first intention was to make a
modification of Hydro's Onkyo skin, but after getting into it I changed my plans.
Everything except the interface's texture and the buttons was created by me. Please check
the credits for more.

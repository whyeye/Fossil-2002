My  very first Winamp skin, originally created on 3rd October 1998, using my
retro-seventies Fossil 2002 wristwatch as inspiration. There is no way I can
provide  you  pictures of this watch,  I havn't found any on www.fossil.com.
I  recommend you visit www.molekyl.com/pulsar to  make yourself  a  picture 
about some original LEDs from the seventies.

My  very first Winamp skin, originally created on 3rd October 1998, using my
This  Five  Star (winamp.com)  skin was published  in various magazines from
Japan  to  Germany. It  also appears,  that many people  got inspired by it,
there  are plenty  of modified  versions around.  I collected  a couple  and
packaged them, you can download them directly from my homepage.

Thanks to Götz Bockstedte who created the silver-texture for me. The buttons
are modified, they appeared originally in Hydro's Onkyo skin.

ABOUT
Ten years! It's been during my internship at Mercedes-Benz, when I used the
absence of my boss to create my very first Winamp skin, Fossil 2002. Years
before iTunes came out, the skin sported a brushed aluminium interface. The
original texture was made by my friend Götz, who -without knowing- inspired
me during my recent visit to update Fossil 2002 for its 10th anniversary.

I didn't believe I'd start designing a new Winamp skin from scratch, until
it just happened. In three days (I work part-time) I managed to come up with
something good enough to upload just in time for the birthday. To be honest,
there are some minor glitches in the initial release, mostly due to the
nasty combination of winshade-mode and the open/minimize/close buttons. I
will look into it and do minor updates, don't worry!


FOSSIL 2002
The Fossil 2002 is a silver metal wristwatch with LED display made by
Fossil, Inc. A while after I purchased the model in a store in Heidelberg,
I learned that it resembles a watch from the 1970s, Pulsar from Seiko. There
have been several models, one of them making a prominent appearance in a
James Bond movie.

First released in October 1998, this Winamp skin was inspired by the Fossil 2002 (JR-7771) wristwatch. Made of stainless steel with red LED, the watch itself is a tribute to the iconic [Pulsar P2](http://www.jamesbondlifestyle.com/product/hamilton-pulsar-p2-2900-led-digital-watch) released in 1973 and worn by Roger Moore in the opening scene of the 007 movie [Live and Let Die](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070328/).

In 2008, on the occasion of the skin's 10th anniversary, “Fossil 2002 III” was released under a [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/) license.
